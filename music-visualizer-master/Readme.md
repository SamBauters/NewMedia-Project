Music Visualizer
================

A quick sketch to do WimAmp-style music visualization
using Processing and the Minim Library ...

### About

You can find my original sketch at OpenProcessing [here](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/5989).   
Since it's still kind of popular I  have updated it for Processing 2.1.1.

**Enjoy :)**
